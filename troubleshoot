The issue arises because matplotlib==2.1.0 and some of the other packages you’re attempting to install have older dependencies or use deprecated configurations incompatible with your Python environment. Additionally, typing tensorflow==1.15.2 or numpy==1.13.3 directly into PowerShell as a command will fail, as they are package names and need to be installed using pip.

Here’s how to resolve this step by step:

1. Check Python Version
Tacotron 2 requires older versions of TensorFlow (like 1.15.2), which may not work with newer Python versions. Use Python 3.6–3.8 for compatibility.

Check your Python version:

bash
Copy code
python --version
If you need an older version, install Python 3.8 from the Python Releases page.

2. Create a Virtual Environment
Using a virtual environment ensures package compatibility and avoids conflicts with system-wide installations.

bash
Copy code
python -m venv tacotron_env
cd tacotron_env
Scripts\activate  # On Windows
3. Upgrade Pip and Tools
Ensure pip, setuptools, and wheel are up to date.

bash
Copy code
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
4. Install Tacotron 2 Requirements
Modify the requirements to work with a modern system. For older packages like matplotlib==2.1.0, you may need to adjust dependencies.

Run this script to install all dependencies with compatibility fixes:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow==1.15.2
pip install numpy==1.16.0
pip install inflect==0.2.5
pip install librosa==0.6.0
pip install scipy==1.0.0
pip install Unidecode==1.0.22
pip install pillow
pip install matplotlib==3.3.4  # Newer version compatible with Python 3.8
5. Handle Matplotlib Compatibility
If you still encounter errors with matplotlib, try this:

Upgrade to the latest compatible version:

bash
Copy code
pip install matplotlib
If older dependencies are required:

bash
Copy code
pip install matplotlib==3.0.0
6. Run Your Code
Once all dependencies are installed, retry running Tacotron 2 and follow through with training and voice generation.

If errors persist, let me know the details, and I’ll troubleshoot further.
